# About
This CLI tool was created to efficiently display income breakdown based on the 50-30-20 rule.
<br/>
<br/>
The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method that splits monthly income among three main categories:
- 50% of your income: needs (housing, food, transportation, basic utilities, insurance) <br/>
- 30% of your income: wants (travel, entertainment, monthly subscriptions, meals out) <br/>
- 20% of your income: savings and debt (paying down existing debt, starting/growing an emergency fund, saving for retirement via 401k or IRA) <br/>
