# About
This CLI tool was created to quickly display the breakdown of income based on the 50-30-20 rule.
<br/>
The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method that splits monthly income among three main categories:
<br/>
50% of your income: needs (housing, food, transportation, basic utilities, insurance)
<br/>
30% of your income: wants (travel, entertainment, monthly subscriptions, meals out)
<br/>
20% of your income: savings and debt (paying down existing debt, starting/growing an emergency fund, saving for retirement via 401k or IRA)
<br/>
<br/>
